# hello-world
Welcome to my first GitHub repository! ðŸŽ‰

My name is Ruchitha Thota, and I'm excited to learn more about coding and software development. I created this "Hello World" program as my first step into the world of programming. I'm currently learning JavaScript and exploring new ways to build cool projects.

Feel free to check out my repository and follow my journey!

I enjoy learning about new technologies.
